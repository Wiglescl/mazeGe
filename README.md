# mazeGe
This program is designed to generate unique mazes, each of which is created randomly and has only one possible path to the exit.
Special attention is paid to make the structure of the maze unique, and to make the passage of the maze exciting and challenging. 
The main idea is that each time the user is faced with a new challenge, but there is still a guarantee of the only correct route to the exit.
